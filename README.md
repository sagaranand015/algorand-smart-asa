# Algorand Smart ASA
The Algorand Smart ASA allows for more flexible way to work with ASAs providing re-configuration functionalities and the possibility of building additional business logics.
This repo is aimed at (this gitcoin bounty)[https://gitcoin.co/issue/29369] for implementing an algorand Smart Contract interacting with Smart ASA providing real world functionality. 

## Abstract
As the new building blocks on the Algorand Blockchain, Smart-ASAs provide the possibility of exploring and implementing custom business logics around operations like asset transfers, royalties, role-based-transfers, limit-amount-transfers, mints, and burns.
Given Algorand Smart-ASAs has such features in-built, we plan to use Algorand Smart Contracts and Smart-ASAs to implement compliance and rewards automatation in the environmental regulatory industry.
